# Hub Control Configuration
# 
# This file allows you to configure how USB hubs are displayed.
# You can hide internal ports, rename hubs, and customize the view.

# Hub configurations are identified by vendor:product ID
# Example: "1a40:0201" for Terminus Technology Inc. hub

[[hubs]]
# Terminus 20-port Hub (appears as 7-port hub with 6x4-port child hubs)
vendor_id = "1a40"
product_id = "0201"
name = "Sipolar A-805P 20 Ports USB 2.0 HUB"

# Total physical ports on this hub
physical_ports = 20

# Ports to hide (internal/inaccessible ports)
# These are specified as "child_hub_index.port_number"
# Child hub index is 1-6 (order they appear in lsusb)
# Port number is 1-4 for each child hub
#
# Example: If child hub 6 ports 3 and 4 are internal, and child hub 5 port 4 is internal:
hidden_ports = [
  # "5.4",  # Child hub 5 (device 42), port 4
  # "6.3",  # Child hub 6 (device 43), port 3
  # "6.4",  # Child hub 6 (device 43), port 4
  # "1.4",  # Child hub 1 (device 38), port 4
]

# Grid layout: Visual arrangement of ports matching physical hub layout
# Use -1 for empty spaces (gaps in the physical layout)
# Each row is an array, rows are separated
# Example for a 20-port hub with 2 rows of 10:
grid_layout = [
  [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
]

# Example with gaps (if your hub has irregular layout):
# grid_layout = [
#   [1, 2, 3, -1, 4, 5, 6],
#   [7, 8, 9, -1, 10, 11, 12],
#   [-1, -1, 13, 14, 15, -1, -1]
# ]

# Port mapping: Maps logical "child_hub.port" to physical port number printed on hub
# This reorders ports in the UI to match the physical labels on your hub.
#
# To discover your mapping:
#   1. Connect a device to physical port 1 on the hub
#   2. Run the app and note which logical port it appears on (e.g., "6.1" shows in portKey)
#   3. Add: "6.1" = 1
#   4. Repeat for all 20 ports
#
# Format: "child_hub_index.port_number" = physical_port_number
#
# Example mapping (you'll need to discover your actual mapping):
[hubs.port_map]
"6.1" = 1
"6.2" = 2
"6.3" = 3
# "6.4" = ?

# "3.1" = ?
"3.2" = 4
"3.3" = 5
"3.4" = 6

"4.1" = 7
"4.2" = 8
"4.3" = 9
"4.4" = 10

"5.1" = 11
"5.2" = 12
# "5.3" = ?
"5.4" = 13

# "2.1" = ?
"2.2" = 14

"2.4" = 16

"1.1" = 17

"1.3" = 19
